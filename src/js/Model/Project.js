a portfolio detailing all of the projects done in the past. During the podcasts of the project technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Web Design

 Overtime I refactored the portfolio project to include technologies and frameworks such as gulp, sass ,knockout and mvvm for better code management`;

/** Project 2: Udacity Front End Nano Degree Online Resume */
var project2Description = `Project 2 of the Udacity Front End Nano Degree Program was to create an online resume. The concept of using template patterns
was discussed during the podcasts in order to complete the project. Another concept that was introduced but is not new to me was version control. Using the git 
version control I was able to keep track of changes and learnt about branching and how version control can make development easier during an applications life cycle.

/** Project 4: Udacity Front End Nano Degree Website Optimization */
var project4Description = `Project 4 of the Udacity Front End Nano Degree Program was a bit different to projects that I'm usally use to developing. Rather than focusing on 
web and application design this project focused on the performance of a website. Using google chrome developer tools, a given solution was analysed and had to be optimizied in order to make the 
website a more friendly user experiance. Other tools such as gulp and ngrok was also used to help reduce jank in the given website.

var project5Description = `Project 5 of the Udacity Front End Nano Degree Program was to create an Neighborhood Map project detailing places that you might want to visit. During the build up to this project
the design patterns were introduced such as MV*, MVC, MVP and MVVM. Later existing frameworks such as knockout js was introduced. Another concept introduced was the integration of 
third party api's. During the neighborhood map project google maps api was required in order to create a map with map markers.
